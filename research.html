            <p>
                This project looks at how lifestyle choices, personal habits, and demographic factors—like age, gender, and race—relate to the risk and overlap of chronic diseases such as heart disease, kidney disease, and skin cancer. These research questions help guide an exploration of the patterns and connections behind who gets sick and why, offering insights into the bigger picture of public health.
